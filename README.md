## Fast Gradient Signed Attack on Age Classifier
Self-explanatory title

### Structure
- example_adv_img: example of adversarial images
- readme_images: images folder we used for this readme
- test: test dataset for age classifier validation
- train: train dataset for age classifier training
- FGSM_AGE.ipynb: application of Fast Grad Sign on trained classifier
- YellowLabradorLooking_new.jpg: just some testing image
- classifier.ipynb: classifier training on notebook
- fast_gradient_example.ipynb: example of application of fast gradient on a different dataset and MobileNetV2 architecture
- generate_adv.py: script to generate adversarial images after having trained classifier in root folder
- train_classifier.py: script to train age classifier
